=== Example-E1 A helper method that translates a absolute Path to a Home Relative string

A Path object can be turned into an absolute path string like:

[source]
----
/Users/kazurayam/github/unittest-helper/lib/
----

In this string you can find my personal name "kazurayam". When I write some document, often I need to copy the output message and paste it into documents. However, I hesitate exposing my personal name public. I would prefer present a path in *Home Relative string* which starts with a tilde character, like:

[source]
----
~/github/unittest-helper/lib/
----

The `TestOutputOrganizer` class provides a helper method that translte a Path object into a Home Relative string. See the following example:

[source, java]
----
include::../app/src/test/java/com/kazurayam/unittesthelperdemo/ExampleE1Test.java[]
----

This test prints the following output in the console:

[source]
----
file absolute: /Users/kazurayam/github/unittest-helper/app/test-output/sample1.txt
file relative: ~/github/unittest-helper/app/test-output/sample1.txt
----
