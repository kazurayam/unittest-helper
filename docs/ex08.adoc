=== Example8 Sub-directory which stands for the Fully Qualified Class Name of the test class

It is a good idea to create a layer of sub-directories, under the output directory, which stands for the Fully Qualified Class Name of the test classes. Please have a look at the following image.

This directory organization is nice because we can easily see which test class created which file.

Also this organization allows you to name files with duplicating names, for example `my-pdf.pdf`. In the above screenshot, you can find 3 files of that name in 3 different sub-directories.

The following code shows how to use "ClassOutputDirectory" managed by `TestOutputOrganizer`.

Please find that this test calls the `getClassOutputDirectory()` method and the `cleanClassOutputDirectory()` method of `TestOutputOrganizer` class. In order to make these methods operational, you MUST specify `.subDirPath(Clazz<?> testClass)` to the `TestOutputOrganizer.Builder`.


This test prints the following:

[test_write_a_file] classOutputDir: ~/github/unittest-helper/app/build/tmp/testOutput/com.kazurayam.unittesthelperdemo.Ex08Test
[test_write_a_file] created a file ~/github/unittest-helper/app/build/tmp/testOutput/com.kazurayam.unittesthelperdemo.Ex08Test/sample.txt
