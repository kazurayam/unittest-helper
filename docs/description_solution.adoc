== Solution

This project provides a Java class link:https://github.com/kazurayam/unittest-helper/blob/develop/lib/src/main/java/com/kazurayam/unittest/TestOutputOrganizer.java[`com.kazurayam.unittest.TestOutputOrganizer`].

The `TestOutputOrganizer` helps your unit tests to save files into a dedicated directory in the Maven/Gradle project. Using this class, you can easily prepare a directory into which your unit tests can write files. The location of the output directory is resolved via the classpath of the unit-test class. The `TestOutputOrganizer` does ot depend on the value returned by `System.getProperty("user.dir")`.

The `TestOutputOrgainzer` class is independent on the type of unit-testing frameworks you choose: JUnit4, JUnit5 and TestNG.

The `TestOutputOrgainzer` class is compiled by Java8.

Using the `TestOutputOrganizer` class, you can well-organize the files created by test classes, as follows:

== How does the `TestOutputOrganizer` resolves the project root directory ?


The `getProject()` method of `TestOutputOrganizer` class internally works as follows.

1. The constructor call `new TestOutputOrganizer.Builder(this.getClass())` tells it should look at the code source of `this` object, which is `/Users/kazurayam/github/unittest-helper/app/build/classes/java/test/com/kazurayam/unittestshelperdemo/OrganizerPresentTest.class`.
2. The `TestOutputOrganizer` internally tries to find out which build tool you used: Maven or Gradle?
If you used Maven, it expects that the project directory to have a subdirectory `target/test-classes`. If the `TestOutputOrganizer` found `target/test-classes` in the code source path, then the parent directory of the `target` directory is presumed to be the project directory.
If you use Gradle, the `TestOutputOrganizer` expects that the project directory would have a subdirectory `build/classes/java/test`. So `TestOutputOrganizer` tries to find `build/classes/java/test` in the code source path. When the subdirectory pattern is found in the code source path, then the parent directory of the `build` directory is presumed to be the project dir.


The `com.kazurayam.unittest.ProjectDirectoryResovler` class has a list of the patterns to match against the code source given. You can che check the content of the list. Let me assume you have the following test code:

[source]
----
include::../app/src/test/java/com/kazurayam/unittesthelperdemo/ProjectDirectoryResolverTest.java[]
----

This test prints the following result in the console:

[source]
----
sublistPattern : [target, test-classes]
sublistPattern : [build, classes, java, test]
sublistPattern : [build, classes, java, functionalTest]
sublistPattern : [build, classes, groovy, test]
sublistPattern : [build, classes, groovy, functionalTest]
sublistPattern : [build, classes, kotlin, test]
sublistPattern : [build, classes, kotlin, functionalTest]
----

The 1st sublistPattern is for Maven. the 2nd, sublistPattern is for Java codes built in Gradle.

Do you need a unique sublistPattern other than those built-in ones?

OK. You can add more sublistPatterns for your own needs by calling the `TestOutputOrganizer.Builder.sublistPattern(List<String>)` method.
