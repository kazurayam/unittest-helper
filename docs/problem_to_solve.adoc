== Problems to solve

Let me show you a set of sample codes to explain the problem that I am focused.

I would assume that you have a clone of the link:https://github.com/kazurayam/unittest-helper[unittest-helper] project on your machine.

Please note that this project is a link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/intro_multi_project_builds.html[Gradle Multi-Project], where the root directory `unittest-helper` contains a few sub-directories `lib`, `app` and `preliminary-study`. Each of these 3 directories contain `build.gradle` file. Multi-Project is just a usual style of Gradle project structure nowadays. It is no exceptional.

Please find link:https://github.com/kazurayam/unittest-helper/preliminary-study/src/test/java/study/S2WritingSystemPropertyValueIntoFileInTheOutputDirectoryTest.java[]:
[source,java]
----
include::../preliminary-study/src/test/java/study/S2WritingSystemPropertyValueIntoFileInTheOutputDirectoryTest.java[]
----

- This code is a unit-test class in Java.
- This test tries to read a Java System Property named `browserType` specified in the commandline option
- This test creates a directory named `test-output`. The `test-output` directory will be located under the so-called *Current Working Directory* which is identified by the System Property `user.dir`.
- This test writes the value of System Property `browserType` into a file named `browserType.txt` which is located in the `test-output` directory.


You can find how the Gradle task `testS2` is defined in the link:https://github.com/kazurayam/unittest-helper/preliminary-study/build.gradle[]

[code,groovy]
----
tasks.register("testS2", Test) {
    useTestNG()                                  // (1)
    include "**/S2*"                             // (2)
    systemProperties System.properties           // (3)
    testLogging { showStandardStreams = true }   // (4)
    outputs.upToDateWhen { false }               // (5)
}
----

1. I declared that I want to use NestNG to run my test cases in the `testS2` task.
2. I specifically chose a class of which className starts with `S2`.
3. I passed all entries of `System.properties`, including the ones given as a commandline parameter by `-DbrowserType=XXXX`, into the `testS2` task
4. I requested Gradle show all of messages from the test classes to stdout to be printed in the console
5. I forced Gradle to run the `testS2` task even if there is no change in the input.

I opened the Terminal app, and ran the following commands.

=== Case1: with the subproject's directory as Current Working Directory

[source,commandline]
----
$ cd ~/github/unittest-helper
$ cd preliminary-study
$ pwd
/Users/kazurayam/github/unittest-helper/preliminary-study
$ gradle testS2 -DbrowserType=Chrome

> Task :preliminary-study:testS2

Gradle suite > Gradle test > study.S2WritingSystemPropertyValueIntoFileInTheOutputDirectoryTest > testIt STANDARD_OUT
    System.property("browserType")=Chrome
    file path=~/github/unittest-helper/preliminary-study/test-output/browserType.txt
    file content=Chrome

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s
2 actionable tasks: 1 executed, 1 up-to-date
----

Please note that the output directory `test-output` was located in the **subproject's directory** `unittest-helper/preliminary-study/`.

=== Case2: with the root project's directory as Current Working Directory

Gradle allows us another way of invoking the same task `testS2`, as follows:

[source,commandline]
----
$ pwd
/Users/kazuakiurayama/github/unittest-helper
:~/github/unittest-helper (issue36 *)
$ gradle :preliminary-study:testS2 -DbrowserType=FireFox

> Task :preliminary-study:testS2

Gradle suite > Gradle test > study.S2WritingSystemPropertyValueIntoFileInTheOutputDirectoryTest > testIt STANDARD_OUT
    System.property("browserType")=FireFox
    file path=~/github/unittest-helper/test-output/browserType.txt
    file content=FireFox

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 3s
2 actionable tasks: 1 executed, 1 up-to-date
----

I am surprised to find that, in the case2, the output directory `test-output` was located in the **root project's directory**; like `unittest-helper/test-output`.

=== Problem: Current Working Directory is not reliable: it moves sometimes

I want my test class `study.S2WritingSystemPropertyValueIntoFileInTheOutputDireoctyTest` to create the directory `test-output` steadily under the subproject's directory.

In the Case1, I got `unittest-helper/preliminary-study/test-output`, with which I am OK. However, in the Case2, I got `unittest-helper/test-output`. I am not happy with the result.

In the Case2, I ran the same test class a bit differently. In the Case1, I ran it in the directory `unittest-helper/preliminary-study`, and in the Case2, I ran it in the directory `unittest-helper`.

In the Case2, I got the `test-output` directory under the `unittest-helper` directory, which is the root project's directory. Why did I get this difference? --- It is because the `testS2` task has a single line:

[code,groovy]
----
tasks.register("testS2", Test) {
    ...
    systemPropert System.properties
    ...
}
----

By this single line, Gradle captured all the values of System.properties at the timing when I invoked `gradle` command and the values were imported into the runtime environment where the test class `S2WrintingSystemPropertyValueIntoFileInTheOutputDirecvtoryTest` ran. In the Case1, the System Property `user.dir` had the value of `/Users/kazurayam/github/unittest-helpers/preliminary-study; and in the Case2, the `user.dir` had the value of `/Users/kazurayam/github/unittest-helper`. Therefore, the directory `test-output` was located at the different layer of project structure.
