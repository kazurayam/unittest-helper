== Problems to solve

Let me explain the problem that I am focused with a sample code.

I cloned the link:https://github.com/kazurayam/unittest-helper[unittest-helper] project onto my Mac machine.

Please note that this project is a link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/intro_multi_project_builds.html[Gradle Multi-Project], where the root directory `unittest-helper` contains a few sub-directories `lib`, `app` and `preliminary-study`. Each of these 3 directories contain `build.gradle` file. Multi-Project is just a usual style of Gradle project structure nowadays. It is no exceptional.

Please find link:https://github.com/kazurayam/unittest-helper/preliminary-study/src/test/java/study/S2WritingSystemPropertyValueIntoFileInTheOutputDirectoryTest.java[]:
[source,java]
----
include::../preliminary-study/src/test/java/study/S2WritingSystemPropertyValueIntoFileInTheOutputDirectoryTest.java[]
----

- This code is a unit-test class in Java.
- This test tries to read a Java System Property named `browserType` specified in the commandline option
- This test creates a directory named `test-output`. The `test-output` directory will be located under the so-called *Current Working Directory* which is identified by the System Property `user.dir`.
- This test writes the value of System Property `browserType` into a file named `browserType.txt` which is located in the `test-output` directory.


You can find how the Gradle task `testS2` is defined in the link:https://github.com/kazurayam/unittest-helper/preliminary-study/build.gradle[]

[code,groovy]
----
tasks.register("testS2", Test) {
    useTestNG()                                  // (1)
    include "**/S2*"                             // (2)
    systemProperties System.properties           // (3)
    testLogging { showStandardStreams = true }   // (4)
    outputs.upToDateWhen { false }               // (5)
}
----

1. I declared that I want to use NestNG to run my test cases in the `testS2` task.
2. I specifically chose a class of which className starts with `S2`.
3. I passed all entries of `System.properties`, including the ones given as a commandline parameter by `-DbrowserType=XXXX`, into the `testS2` task
4. I requested Gradle show all of messages from the test classes to stdout to be printed in the console
5. I forced Gradle to run the `testS2` task even if there is no change in the input.

I opened the Terminal app, and ran the following commands.

=== Case1: with the subproject's directory as Current Working Directory

[source,commandline]
----
$ cd ~/github/unittest-helper
$ cd preliminary-study
$ pwd
/Users/kazurayam/github/unittest-helper/preliminary-study
$ gradle testS2 -DbrowserType=Chrome

> Task :preliminary-study:testS2

Gradle suite > Gradle test > study.S2WritingSystemPropertyValueIntoFileInTheOutputDirectoryTest > testIt STANDARD_OUT
    System.property("browserType")=Chrome
    file path=~/github/unittest-helper/preliminary-study/test-output/browserType.txt
    file content=Chrome

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s
2 actionable tasks: 1 executed, 1 up-to-date
----

Please note that the output directory `test-output` was located in the **subproject's directory** `unittest-helper/preliminary-study/`.

=== Case2: with the root project's directory as Current Working Directory

Gradle allows us another way of invoking the same task `testS2`, as follows:

[source,commandline]
----
$ pwd
/Users/kazuakiurayama/github/unittest-helper
:~/github/unittest-helper (issue36 *)
$ gradle :preliminary-study:testS2 -DbrowserType=FireFox

> Task :preliminary-study:testS2

Gradle suite > Gradle test > study.S2WritingSystemPropertyValueIntoFileInTheOutputDirectoryTest > testIt STANDARD_OUT
    System.property("browserType")=FireFox
    file path=~/github/unittest-helper/test-output/browserType.txt
    file content=FireFox

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 3s
2 actionable tasks: 1 executed, 1 up-to-date
----

I am surprised to find that, in the case2, the output directory `test-output` was located in the **root project's directory**; like `unittest-helper/test-output`.

=== Problem: Current Working Directory is not reliable: it moves sometimes

I want my test class `study.S2WritingSystemPropertyValueIntoFileInTheOutputDireoctyTest` to create the directory `test-output` steadily under the subproject's directory.

In the Case1, I got `unittest-helper/preliminary-study/test-output`, with which I am OK. However, in the Case2, I got `unittest-helper/test-output`. I am not happy with the result.

In the Case2, I ran the same test class a bit differently. In the Case1, I ran it in the directory `unittest-helper/preliminary-study`, and in the Case2, I ran it in the directory `unittest-helper`.

In the Case2, I got the `test-output` directory under the `unittest-helper` directory, which is the root project's directory. Why did I get this difference? --- It is because the `testS2` task has a single line:

[code,groovy]
----
tasks.register("testS2", Test) {
    ...
    systemPropert System.properties
    ...
}
----

By this single line, Gradle captured all the values of System.properties at the timing when I invoked `gradle` command and the values were imported into the runtime environment where the test class `S2WrintingSystemPropertyValueIntoFileInTheOutputDirecvtoryTest` ran. In the Case1, the System Property `user.dir` had the value of `/Users/kazurayam/github/unittest-helpers/preliminary-study; and in the Case2, the `user.dir` had the value of `/Users/kazurayam/github/unittest-helper`. Therefore, the directory `test-output` was located at the different layer of project structure.

=== I want to locate the output directory under the subProject's directory

I want the `test-output` directory to be steadily located under the subproject's directory `preliminary-study/` regardless at which directory the System property `user.dir` is set at runtime. For that intent, I do not like to rely on the value of System property `user.dir` to find out where the subproject directory is.

=== How can I find the supProject's directory without `user.dir`?

There is a method for a test classes to find out the location of project's directory without referring to the System property `user.dir`. I will show you a sample code how to.

Please find link:https://github.com/kazurayam/unittest-helper/preliminary-study/src/test/java/study/S3FindingProjectDirByClasspathTest.java[]:
[source,java]
----
include::../preliminary-study/src/test/java/study/S3FindingProjectDirByClasspathTest.java[]
----

You can run this test by `testS3` task defined in the `unittest-helper/preliminary-study/build.gradle`. I ran it and got messages, as follows:

[code,commandline]
----
$ pwd
/Users/kazuakiurayama/github/unittest-helper/preliminary-study

$ gradle testS3

> Task :preliminary-study:testS3

Gradle suite > Gradle test > study.S3FindingProjectDirByClasspathTest > getLocationWhereThisClassIsFound STANDARD_OUT
    codeSource url=file:/Users/kazuakiurayama/github/unittest-helper/preliminary-study/build/classes/java/test/
    project directory=file:/Users/kazuakiurayama/github/unittest-helper/preliminary-study/

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s
2 actionable tasks: 1 executed, 1 up-to-date
----

And also I ran the same task at a different directory

[code,commandline]
----
$ pwd
/Users/kazuakiurayama/github/unittest-helper

$ gradle :preliminary-study:testS3

> Task :preliminary-study:testS3

Gradle suite > Gradle test > study.S3FindingProjectDirByClasspathTest > getLocationWhereThisClassIsFound STANDARD_OUT
    codeSource url=file:/Users/kazuakiurayama/github/unittest-helper/preliminary-study/build/classes/java/test/
    project directory=file:/Users/kazuakiurayama/github/unittest-helper/preliminary-study/

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s
2 actionable tasks: 1 executed, 1 up-to-date
----

As you see, in both cases, the test class printed the same path string as the project directory:

[code,commandline]
----
    project directory=file:/Users/kazuakiurayama/github/unittest-helper/preliminary-study/
----

I like this result. The test class `S3FindingProjectDirByClasspathTest` proved that it can find where the subproject's directory is without refering to the System property `user.dir`. Please read the source of `getLocationWhereThisClassIsFound()` method to find out the coding technique.

=== Introducing "Code Source Path Elements"

Let me introduce a new terminology "Code Source Path Elements".

Let me assume I have a file on my machine with the actual path of:

`/Users/kazurayam/github/unittest-helper/preliminary-study/build/classes/java/test/study/S3FindingProjectDirByClasspathTest.class`

I can analyze this long path string into 4 segments, as follows:

- Gradle *root project' directory*: `/Users/kazurayam/github/unittest-helper/`
- Gradle *subproject's directory*: `preliminary-study/`
- link:https://github.com/kazurayam/unittest-helper/blob/issue36/lib/src/main/java/com/kazurayam/unittest/CodeSourcePathElementsUnderProjectDirectory.java[*Code Source Path Elements*]: `build/classes/java/test/`
- class path: `study/S3FindingProjectDirByClasspathTest.class`

=== Difficulties to overcome

Read the source of `getLocationWhereThisClassIsFound` method of link:https://github.com/kazurayam/unittest-helper/preliminary-study/src/test/java/study/S3FindingProjectDirByClasspathTest.java[S3FindingProjectDirByClasspathTest]. You would notice a technical issue to overcome. The method has a fragment:

[code, java]
----
        String codeSourcePathElementsUnderProjectDirectory = "build/classes/java/test/";
        String projectDir =
                url.toString().replace(codeSourcePathElementsUnderProjectDirectory,"");

----

Here you find a string literal `build/classes/java/test/` which is a valid path elements under the project directory only in a Gradle Java project. Different string literals would be required for other Languages (Groovy, Kotlin), for other Build Tools (Gradle, Maven, Ant), for other IDEs (IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, etc). In other words, the "Code Source Path Elements" is dependent on the runtime environment. If I want my test classes to be able to find the subProject's directory runtime, my test classes have to be able to try all the possible values of "Code Source Path Elements" to find the one that exactly matches the runtime environment.

The `com.kazurayam.unittest.ProjectDirectoryResolver` class provides a solution to this issue.
