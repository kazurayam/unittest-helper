=== Example2 Resolving the project directory resolved via classpath

I want my tests to be able to resolve the path of the project directory so that my tests can locate temporary output files surely under the project directory. And I want my tests to be independent from the *current working directory*. I want to find out the project directory's path value based on the path value of the class file of the test itself. The following code shows it is possible.

[source, java]
----
include::../app/src/test/java/com/kazurayam/unittesthelperdemo/ProjectDirectoryResolverTest.java[lines=1..23]
----
link:https://github.com/kazurayam/unittest-helper/blob/develop/app/src/test/java/com/kazurayam/unittesthelperdemo/ProjectDirectoryResolverTest.java[source]

This will print the following in the console:

[source]
----
projectDir: /Users/kazurayam/github/unittest-helper/app
----

How the `com.kazurayam.unittest.ProjectDirectoryResolver` class find the path of project directory via classpath? --- I will describe the detail later. For now, let me talk about how to utilize this library.
