=== Example6 Writing a file into a subdirectory under the default output directory


[source, java]
----
include::../app/src/test/java/com/kazurayam/unittesthelperdemo/Ex06Test.java[]
----
link:https://github.com/kazurayam/unittest-helper/blob/develop/app/src/test/java/com/kazurayam/unittesthelperdemo/Ex06Test.java[source]

This will print the following in the console:

[source]
----
[test_write_into_subdir_under_the_default_output_directory] p = ~/github/unittest-helper/app/test-output/sub/sample.txt
----

You can create layers of sub-directories under the output directory managed by the `TestOutputOrganizer`. But you are responsible to make sure the parent directory of a file is present. So the following statement was necessary:

[source]
----
        Path file = too.getOutputDirectory().resolve("sub/sample.txt");
        // you need to make sure that the parent directory exists
        Files.createDirectories(file.getParent());
