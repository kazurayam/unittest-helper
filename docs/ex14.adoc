=== Example14 Factory class that creates customized TestOutputOrganizer

It is a good practice for you to define a factory class that creates an instance of `TestOutputOrganizer` with your custom parameters for your own project. Use the factory throughout your project. Then you can standardize the organization of test outputs.

See the following example "factory".

[source]
----
include::../app/src/test/java/io/github/someone/examples/TestOutputOrganizerFactory.java[]
----

This `TestOutputOrganizerFactory` class implements only a single static method `create(Class)` method which will instantiate a `com.kazurayam.unittest.TestOutputOrganizer` class with customized parameter values.

The following code is using the Factory.

[source]
----
include::../app/src/test/java/io/github/someone/examples/SampleTest.java[lines=1..42]
----

When you ran the test, the output directory will look like this:

[source]
----
app/build/tmp/testOutput
└── io.github.someone.examples.SampleTest
    └── test_write_file
        └── sample_20231103_094817.txt
